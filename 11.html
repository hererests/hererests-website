<h3>fibrillation</h3>

<br><i>i can never get used to how you make me feel.</i>

<p>how you spin my world out of its orbit
<br>and draw my breathing to a complete halt.

<p><i>i can never get used to how you make me feel.</i>
<br>how you make my belly explode in happy fluttering monarchs
<br>and cause my heart to pulsate at the speed of light to the rhythm of their wings.

<p><i>i can never get used to how you make me feel.</i>
<br>you always have a way of throwing me into an emotional frenzy,
<br>like some trick up your sleeve each time,
<br>nothing like the last, each time, a first-time feeling.

<p><i><b>so how, then, can i get used to how you make me feel?</i></b>
