<h3>first kiss</h3>

<br>when your lips touched mine,
<br>the ground fell away;
<br>i was barely on my feet
<br>and there was damn all to break the fall.
<p>
at that moment,
<br>i could no longer think;
<br>raw emotions surged where reason once was,
<br><i>i could only feel</i>.
<p>
all logic took flight in that one kiss
<br>along with the butterflies ‚Äî their restless wings
<br>stirring a storm in my belly,
<br>tossing every good sense I had.
<p>
i was a parched earth,
<br>getting its very first taste of rain
<br>darling, maybe it was only a drizzle to you
<br>but to me, it was a hurricane.
<p>
in that ephemeral gentle collision of two galaxies,
<br>the universe stood still, the world fell quiet,
<br>leaving space only for the beat of twain hearts
<br>and the electric hum of one beautiful connection.
<p>
time held its breath as we shared ours;
<br>a symphony of silence played in the background
<br>(even the cicadas were speechless)
<br>as we went on with our wordless conversation in the small hours.
<p>
when your lips touched mine,
<br>i am certain i was solid then,
<br>but boy did i melt away
<br>and suddenly, all the words no longer rhymed.
