<h3>the wee hours are ours; so is this love</h3>


<br>the wee hours have seen it all -
<br>from all the late night conversations
<br>about everything and nothing
<br>to past-bedtime hangouts;
<br>from the teasing and subtle flirting
<br>to silent pillow-screams
<br>and racing of hearts;
<p>
<br>the wee hours have seen it all -
<br>from the constant push and pull of more than platonic feeling
<br>to almost, almost <i>(drunk and sober)</i> confessions;
<p>
<br>the wee hours have seen it all -
<br>from the screw-it-i-love-you moments
<br>to the crimes we commit for this love;
<p>
<br>the wee hours have seen it all -
<br>i am glad we have them
<br>to bear witness to it all -
<br>to bear witness to this love story
<br>that not one soul should know of
<br>but us;
<p>
<br><i>the wee hours have seen it all -</i> 
<br>and that is enough.
