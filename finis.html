<h3>finis</h3>

<br>write with me one last midnight memory,
<br>something to put in my treasure chest.
<p>
for the last time, wrap me in your arms so tight
<br>i would feel the fragments of my heart
<br>sticking back together.
<p>
under the glow of the moonlight,
<br>lock your lips with mine to communicate
<br>what words could not.
<p>
let us slow dance to <i>basket case</i>
<br>then sing it to our hearts' content.
<p>
and when it is time to go,
<br>darling, drive slow and we take the long way home.
<p>
for the last time, write with me
<br>what will be a future <i>history</i>.
<p>
let's not waste a second
<br>and make the little while beautiful and seem like forever.

<p>
<br>
<br>for the last time,
<br>let us make the wee hours <i>ours</i> once more

<p>
<br>
before i let go.
